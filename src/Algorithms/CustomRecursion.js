/**
 * Recursion has two fundamental aspects: the base case and the recursive step.

  When using iteration, we rely on a counting variable and a boolean condition.
  For example, when iterating through the values in a list,
  we would increment the counting variable until it exceeded the length of the dataset.

  Recursive functions have a similar concept, which we call the base case.
  The base case dictates whether the function will recurse, or call itself. Without a base case,
  itâ€™s the iterative equivalent to writing an infinite loop.
